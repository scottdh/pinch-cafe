# Pinch Cafe

A dashboard-style page to be displayed in the lobby of Pinch Cafe, Tooting Works, Tooting, London.

Includes the cafe's menu, times for various nearby public transport, and whatever else we feel might be handy.

This is a community project - we meet up in Pinch Cafe every other Thursday evening (6:30pm). See [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sw-london-design-code-coffee-eve/) for more details.

## Installation

If you want a local development version installed on your local machine you will need Node.js installed.

The hosted version used in the cafe can be found [here](https://dev.sansay.co.uk/pinch-cafe).
