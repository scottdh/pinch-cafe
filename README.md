# Pinch Cafe

A dashboard-style page to be displayed in the lobby of Pinch Cafe, Tooting Works, Tooting, London.

Includes the cafe's menu, times for various nearby public transport, and whatever else we feel might be handy.

This is a community project - we meet up in Pinch Cafe every other Thursday evening (6:30pm). See [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sw-london-design-code-coffee-eve/) for more details.
